## TASK: From previous task, commit your Terraform file to GitHub Repo (preferably public). For this task, make a new branch and commit the changes relating to Variable and Outputs usage on another branch.

I created a new repository named `ec2-s3-terraform` and uploaded the initial `main.tf` file, which provisions an EC2 instance and an S3 bucket using core Terraform principles such as providers, resources and data sources.  
After that, I created a new branch from the `ec2-s3-terraform` repository, added the necessary `variables` and `outputs` and also updated the `main.tf` file to reference those variables. I then pushed all the changes back to the `main` branch.
